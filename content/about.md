I have always been interested in technology, and have followed that path for my entire professional career. I started at [Penn State University][1] studying Computer Science and Engieering. I earned my BS in Computer Engieering, followed by my MS and PhD in Computer Science and Engieering. I focused my graduate studies on cybersecurity, specifically looking at ways to build systems that protect the integrity of the system and the data being hosted.

After graduating from PSU, I started as a research scientist at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory][2], where I continued the cybersecurity theme. I worked on a number of different projects before settling into a research project looking at data provenance. This was a natural extension of the system and data integrity work I was doing during my graduate studies. While working on data provenance, I was fortunate to collaborate with a number of talented researchers across academia and industry.

While working on data provenenance in collaboration with my univeristy colleagues, I decided to try my hand at teaching and moved to [UNC Charlotte][3], where I was an assitant professor teaching cybersecurity related classes and continuing the data provenance research. I developed an interest in graph representational learning and collaborated with my peers at UNC Charlotte to apply machine learning to data provenance.

After a time, I realized that I loved teaching and building/debugging systems, but not the other academic prusuits. This led to some searching on my part. I decided to find a new career where I could be more directly involved with technology. This resulted in my current postiion as a Staff Engineer at [Canonical][4] in the Sustaining Engineering group. In this role, I work with customer issues, debugging and supporting their needs.
