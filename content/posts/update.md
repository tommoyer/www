Things have been quiet here for a long time. I hope to address that going forward. I plan to post things more regularly about what I am doing and the things I am learning. Right now things are in a state of flux and I am hoping things settle down here very soon. More details to come, especially related to my new homelab setup and how I am managing everything.
